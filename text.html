            <p>Bandwidth: This refers to the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over an internet connection. For fiber optic internet, bandwidth is typically much higher than other types of internet connections like DSL or cable, allowing for faster data transfer and better performance for activities such as streaming, gaming, and large file downloads.</p>
            <p>Latency: This is the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination and back. Fiber optic connections usually offer lower latency compared to other types of internet connections, which is crucial for activities that require real-time data transmission like online gaming, video conferencing, and VoIP calls. Lower latency means a more responsive and seamless online experience.</p>
            <p>Megabits: Megabits per second (Mbps) is a common measurement for internet speed. For example, a 100 Mbps connection can transfer 100 million bits of data per second. This is typically used to describe consumer-level internet speeds, ranging from a few Mbps for basic connections to several hundred Mbps for faster broadband services.</p>
             <p>Gigabits per second (Gbps) is used for very high-speed internet connections. For example, a 1 Gbps connection can transfer one billion bits of data per second. This is commonly used to describe extremely fast internet services, often provided by fiber optic networks, capable of handling high-demand applications like large-scale data transfers, ultra-high-definition streaming, and advanced cloud services.</p>
