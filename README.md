            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Tanner Morris, and I am currently a computer science major at Southwestern College. I have a strong passion for technology and enjoy learning about the latest advancements in the field. In my free time, I like to work on personal projects like smart home hobbies, as well as exploring new programming languages and frameworks.</p>
            <p>Apart from my academic pursuits, I have several hobbies that keep me busy. I am an avid user of home automation technology and enjoy configuring and customizing smart home devices through an open source program called "Home Assistant". This is perfect for locally ran smart home equipment and perfect for DIYers that like to learn new things. Additionally, I am interested in WiFi and fiber optic internet since that is where I work and worked 2 years as a Fiber Technician and now transitioning into an IT position that has me working on AI integrations at the moment. Lastly, my wife and I are apart of a local church in Hutchinson, KS (Grace Bible Church) and are very involved in different ministries.</p>

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>In the next steps, I plan to enhance my portfolio by adding detailed project pages for each assignment, complete with descriptions, screenshots, and live demos. I will also focus on improving the site's design and responsiveness using advanced CSS techniques and possibly incorporating JavaScript for interactive elements.</p>
